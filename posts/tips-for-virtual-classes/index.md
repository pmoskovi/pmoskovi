With COVID-19 upon us, bringing school closures and shelter in place orders, we all need to change gears and adjust to call of the times. Here I collected some of the best practices I learned first hand from running and participating in online sessions throughout the years.

Since many of my friends decided to give Zoom a try, when it comes to screenshots and tool examples, that's what I'll use. Wherever I can, I try my best to call out other tools as well.

<h2>Class Preparation</h2>

Given that you have no direct physical contact with your students, it's important to communicate with them in a clear and concise manner. Assuming that they know when their class is (recurring calendar invites may help here), you should try your best to provide a solid, permanent location for your <b>class communication</b>. It can be a web page, a google doc, a wiki page - anything really, as long as it meets two important requirements. It is:
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>URL addressable</b>: that is accessible from a web browser, such as Chrome, or Safari; and the URL doesn't change.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Editable</b>: you can make changes to it on-the-fly without <em>too much</em> effort.
  </li>
</ul>

Your class communication page or document should contain the following:

<ul>
  <li>
    Name and description of the class
  </li>
  <li>
    Name and contact information (e.g.: email) of the teacher
  </li>
  <li>
    Schedule of the class
  </li>
  <li>
    Link to the online event (e.g.: Zoom URL)
  </li>
  <li>
    Description and content of previous classes
  </li>
  <li>
    Class expectations, advise, tips
  </li>
  <li>
    Video conferencing tips and tricks
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>

</ul>
<h2>Download, Install, Setup</h2>

Chances are you won't be able to physically look over the shoulders of your students, you should make sure everybody succeeded downloading, installing, and setting up their web conferencing environment. If this first step fails, the rest of this tutorial is of no use, your students are disconnected. Be sure to use alternative communication channels (email, phone, text) to confirm your students are ready to go.

The download and installation steps for Zoom will differ, depending on the type of device you are using.

<b>Pro Tip:</b> You can have friends or study-groups work together on the setup and request them to ensure that everybody on the team is ready to roll.

<h2>Zoom License</h2>
Zoom, like many other online tools offer a free version. It always makes sense to give the tool a spin before buying. However, if you want to be productive, it is highly recommended to get a paid license of Zoom; it will eliminate most of the limitations that you'll feel constrained by when using the free version. Two of the most important features that you get with the paid license: live interactive polls and no time limits on the sessions.
